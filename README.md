Sentiment Analysis Web Application
This repository provides a web-based sentiment analysis tool built using Gradio and Hugging Face's Transformers. The application analyzes the sentiment of input text and provides a sentiment label (Positive/Negative) along with the confidence score.

Features
Real-time sentiment analysis of text input.
Provides sentiment labels (Positive/Negative) with confidence scores.
Simple and interactive web-based interface built with Gradio.
Pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face.
Requirements
To run the sentiment analysis application locally, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Gradio
Hugging Face Transformers

How It Works
The application uses the pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline from Hugging Face's Transformers library to classify the sentiment of any input text.
The model predicts whether the text is Positive or Negative and returns a confidence score for the prediction.

Acknowledgments
This project uses the Gradio library for creating the user interface.
The sentiment analysis model is powered by Hugging Face Transformers.
